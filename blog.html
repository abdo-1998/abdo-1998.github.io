            <p class="content">Ahh Instagram, with over 1 billion monthly active users, it’s definitely one of the most popular social media apps outhere.
            So, you're posting great content, you're engaging with your followers, posting fun stories with polls and stuff, but
            you just dont quite understand why you're not getting the engagment you're supposed to get and the new followers you're hoping for. And that's
            what explains why you're currently reading our blog. We've been there, the truth is that growing an Instagram page is a tough task even if you're 
            following all the steps and doing everything the way it's supposed to be done, Instagram will knock you out, we're here to help you get back up. Let's get
            started.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <div id="likes">
            <p class="subtitle">Instagram Likes</p>
            <p class="content">Don’t expect people to like everything you post on your page, because people are
                very picky and some of them don’t even bother to press that cuddly heart button no matter how good you think your post is.
                So what you must do is be very selective about what you post and only choose to post what
                you and others might think is appealing and likable. <br><br>One thing I used to do before posting on my page
                is ask a couple of friends their opinion about the picture I’m about to post and see if they would
                double tap it. It’s also very important to ask yourself that question too.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        


        <p id="viral"></p>
        <div class="footer-basic" style="border-radius: 20px;">
            <p class="subtitle">Viral posts</p>
            <p class="content">Viral posts. The quickest way to get an insane follower and engagement boost. It happens
                occasionally and when it does, the results are amazing. There’s really no way of telling if the photo
                you’re about to post is going to become viral or not. I once posted a picture and it started off slow.
                But the next day I woke up to find out that it got to almost 3,500 likes when I had only about 2,000
                followers. Of course, you’re here to find out how to get your posts to be viral! Well the quickest and
                most effective way to achieve that is by posting a picture that’s already been viral. You’ll then have
                a higher chance of reaching the explore page. <br><br>But if you’re not into reposting, don’t worry, you’ll get
                viral posts eventually, my first original post made it by using the correct combination of relevant hashtags 
                and quality content.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <p id="followers"></p>
        <div>
            <p class="subtitle">Your Instagram followers</p>
            <p class="content">With hundreds of likes on your posts and viral posts, you’ll start seeing followers flooding to your
                Instagram account in no time, but if you’re not getting any of those two, or if you’re just getting
                started, here’s a starter tip: choose a page that has the same niche as yours (as long as it has 10k+
                followers) and go to the page's followers tab, and start following around 100 people from the his followers list. On the next day, unfollow
                the ones who did not follow back, and wait a few hours before following 100 more to avoid getting banned
                from following for 24 hours, and repeat the process. <br><br> Another method that you can do to get more followers is trying to be
                more engaging with your current followers, reply to their comments on your posts, like their photos,
                post stories and use hashtags correctly.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        
    

        <p id="bio"></p>
        <div class="footer-basic" style="border-radius: 20px;">
            <p class="subtitle">Instagram bio and post captions</p>
            <p class="content">Having a nice, attractive bio is also very important. It might be the reason many of the
                followers are pressing that ‘follow’ button. Captions each time you post are equally important. Let's
                start with the bio first, try to make it as professional as possible. What I mean by that is don’t
                capitalize a lot of words, don’t stuff the bio with emojis, and don’t talk about your life story in it,
                no one wants to know about you unless you’re a celebrity (its harsh I know but it’s also true). Just
                say in a few words what your page is about and keep it simple.
                <br><br>
                Now, the captions. By the time you have 500+ posts you’ll have to squeeze out every drop of
                imagination to come up with a new caption, and you’ll start forgetting whether you already used
                that caption in another post (no one will notice). My captions are usually 3 to 6 words long,
                and no more, maybe sometimes it's less. Unless you have a message for your audience or you’re doing
                an Ad or a promotion for somebody. The caption you pick should simply describe what your
                post is about, maybe describe or mention (very effective) something you see in your post or say
                something abstract or use complicated words.
            </p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <p id="pagename"></p>
        <div>
            <p class="subtitle">Instagram page name</p>
            <p class="content">Your page name is the most important thing about your entire business, you should be
                very creative while brainstorming a name because you might end up selling customized merch that has
                your logo and name on them. It's very <span class="red">important</span> to try and not include any
                special character in your page name, that will ruin the entire merch opportunity because then you’ll be
                forced to rebrand or style your merch with a name that’s different from your page name, which is for me
                a <span class="red">disaster</span>.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>


        <p id="logo"></p>
        <div class="footer-basic" style="border-radius: 20px;">
            <p class="subtitle">Your page logo</p>
            <p class="content hov">Having a decent looking logo is equally important as having an appealing page name, hire
                a designer if you must, or learn to design a logo on YouTube, that’s what I did. It’s important for the
                same reasons in <a href="#bio">#4</a>.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <p id="times"></p>
        <div>
            <p class="subtitle">Instagram Posting times and Frequency</p>
            <p class="content">Before we start off with the posting times and frequency, make sure that your page is
                on business profile mode.
                It's necessary that you know when your followers are at the peak of their activity when you decide to
                share a new post. The best way of finding out the peak time is by going to your page insights
                (activated after switching to business profile) and reading your stats. Posting frequency is yet
                another important aspect in growing your page, the first rule about posting is that you should <span
                    class="red">never</span> post 2 consecutive photos, it will mess up your engagement and will only
                confuse your audience. Instead, post every day at the same time (this should be at the peak times) and
                no more than 4 posts per day. Like 4 is the maximum I would choose. You can always force your audience
                to adapt to your different posting times, but that might take a while and you might lose followers in the process.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <p id="outs"></p>
        <div class="footer-basic" style="border-radius: 20px;">
            <p class="subtitle">Post Shoutouts</p>
            <p class="content">There’s really no shame in buying shoutouts from bigger and more known pages, it’s the
                easiest way to gain new followers because you’ll be exposed to the fan base of the page you bought a
                shoutouts from. But be careful who you’re buying a shoutout from, some big pages out there have tons of
                fake followers and use fake likes programs to make it look like they’re getting normal likes. You can
                also talk with pages that have the same niche as yours and a similar number of followers as your page
                and agree to do a Shoutout for Shoutout.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <p id="groups"></p>
        <div>
            <p class="subtitle">Instagram Engagement Groups</p>
            <p class="content">Engagement groups are very helpful in improving your engagement rate, and it might also
                help your posts get to the explore page and go viral. Getting into engagement groups is very easy, all
                you must do is DM other pages and ask them to add you to some groups. Piece of cake! For those of you
                who don’t know, engagement groups are groups on Instagram that has pages that like and comment to each
                other’s posts. And make sure to get in engagement groups that have a similar niche as yours, it’s not
                very important but it’s better that way.<br><br> **The following might be true or not: Its being said all over
                the place that these IG groups will not help with increasing your posts’ engagement at all with the new
                IG algorithm, because everyone in these groups is using the same comment repeatedly so you
                might risk being shadow-banned or being flagged for using bots. Please be careful with choosing the
                groups and only pick ones where users will comment with human-like comments.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <p id="hashtags"></p>
        <div class="footer-basic" style="border-radius: 20px;">
            <p class="subtitle">The correct way to use hashtags</p>
            <p class="content">Hashtags are really a double-edged sword, sometimes they work, other times they don't, but
                when they do, they really impact your post performance. I usually search for the most popular hashtags related 
                to my niche, and the most trending ones. And try to choose hashtags that have different repost popularity,
                don't just choose the ones with over 1 million reposts, because it's really hard to be the top post when a new picture
                is posted every few seconds on that hashtags. I also use my own hashtag (#carroofies). There’s no harm in making your own 
                hashtag, it might be popular some day!
                <br><br><span class="red">**Update: </span>Also,
                with the new Instagram algorithm, be careful while using your hashtags. Do not use hashtags that have
                been flagged by Instagram, and do not use the same hashtags repeatedly in all your posts or
                you will risk being flagged as a bot or even shadow-banned. And it’s also being passed around that
                hashtags will no longer be active if they are posted in the comments.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>


        <p id="ban"></p>
        <div>
            <p class="subtitle"><span class="red">(NEW)</span> How to get out of the Instagram Shadowban</p>
            <p class="content">Shadow banning is when Instagram will hide your posts from the users following you and
                only 10% of you followers will be able to see it, and your post will also not appear on the hashtags
                you have used. The best ways to get out of the shadow-ban are the following: 1) Delete the hashtags from all 
                the posts that you might think are shadow-banned. 2) Stop posting for at least 48
                hours, some believe that doing so will reset your account and you will no longer be shadow-banned by
                Instagram. 3)You can also switch back to personal profile in the IG app settings and disconnect your
                Facebook page from your Instagram page but that’s a little bit too extreme.</p>

        <div class="footer-basic" style="border-radius: 20px;">
            <p class="subtitle">Bonus Strategy</p>
            <p class="content">The following might not work for everyone, but you should give it go. This is related to
                the posting times strategy #6. What I do is share a post right before the peak time, say 2 or 3 hours
                before and let that post get all the engagement it can get. The I post another one at the peak time,
                but what happens is that the post at the peak time now has a higher chance of becoming viral than when
                I only share one post per day at the peak time. Don’t ask me why, it just worked out for me, and it
                might work out for you too! </p>

            is no easy task, it takes a lot of time, patience and dedication. If you truely have great content and you're starting to believe
            that your page is not gonna work out, you're gonna start thinking about quitting. I'm here to tell you that when these thoughts 
            start formulating in your head, then this is the time to NOT quit. Keep posting on a daily basis, engage with your audience, and most
            importantly, enjoy doing it. <br><br> Good luck with your page !</p>
